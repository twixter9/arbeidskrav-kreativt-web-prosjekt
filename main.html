                A billionaire socialite who, after witnessing his parents' death in a mugging a
                t age 8, travels the world for seven years before returning home to operate as a bat-masked 
                vigilante hailed as Gotham City's "Dark Knight", using fear against the city's criminal underworld 
                at night. Bale said he was confident in his choice to return in the role because of the positive response 
                to his portrayal in Batman Begins. He continued training in the Keysi Fighting Method and performed many 
                of his own stunts, but did not gain as much muscle as in the previous film because the new Batsuit allowed 
                him to move with greater agility. Bale described Batman's dilemma as whether "[his crusade is] something that has 
                an end. Can he quit and have an ordinary life?
