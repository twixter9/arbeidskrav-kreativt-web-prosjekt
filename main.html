                Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne / Batman:
                A billionaire socialite who, after witnessing his parents' death in a mugging a
                t age 8, travels the world for seven years before returning home to operate as a bat-masked 
                vigilante hailed as Gotham City's "Dark Knight", using fear against the city's criminal underworld 
                at night. Bale said he was confident in his choice to return in the role because of the positive response 
                to his portrayal in Batman Begins. He continued training in the Keysi Fighting Method and performed many 
                of his own stunts, but did not gain as much muscle as in the previous film because the new Batsuit allowed 
                him to move with greater agility. Bale described Batman's dilemma as whether "[his crusade is] something that has 
                an end. Can he quit and have an ordinary life?

                James 'Jim' Gordon is portrayed by Gary Oldman in Nolan's film series. A stern and moral officer, Gordon initially loses
                hope of protecting Gotham when he sees just how corrupt it is with a majority of the police department answering to the
                mob. He finds newfound hope though in the appearance of Batman, who he soon begins to work with to finally clean up the
                streets of Gotham and give it the peace that it was overdue to have for decades. Throughout their partnership, Gordon
                and Batman not only face organized crime and random violence, but a variety of new threats to Gotham with the emergence
                of several villains with their own designs for the city.
